# TALON: Techonology-Agnostic Long Read Analysis Pipeline
# Author: Dana Wyman
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# filter_talon_transcripts.py is a utility that filters the transcripts inside
# a TALON database to produce a transcript whitelist. This list can then be 
# used by downstream analysis tools to determine which transcripts and other
# features should be reported (for example in a GTF file).
